<p>Attributes may be associated with each netCDF variable to specify such
properties as units, special values, maximum and minimum valid values,
scaling factors, and offsets. Attributes for a netCDF file are
defined when the file is first created, while the netCDF dataset is
in define mode. Additional attributes may be added later by reentering
define mode. A netCDF attribute has a netCDF variable to which it is
assigned, a name, a type, a length, and a sequence of one or more
values. An attribute is designated by its variable ID and name. When
an attribute name is not known, it may be designated by its variable
ID and number in order to determine its name, using the function
ncmpi_inq_attname.
</p>
<p>The attributes associated with a variable are typically defined
immediately after the variable is created, while still in define
mode. The data type, length, and value of an attribute may be changed
even when in data mode, as long as the changed attribute requires no
more space than the attribute as originally defined.
</p>
<p>It is also possible to have attributes that are not associated with
any variable. These are called global attributes and are identified by
using NC_GLOBAL as a variable pseudo-ID. Global attributes are usually
related to the netCDF file as a whole and may be used for purposes
such as providing a title or processing history for a netCDF file.
</p>
<p>Operations supported on attributes are:
</p><ul>
<li> Create an attribute, given its variable ID, name, data type, length, and value.

</li><li> Get attribute&rsquo;s data type and length from its variable ID and name.

</li><li> Get attribute&rsquo;s value from its variable ID and name.

</li><li> Copy attribute from one netCDF variable to another.

</li><li> Get name of attribute from its number.

</li><li> Rename an attribute.

</li><li> Delete an attribute.
</li></ul>
