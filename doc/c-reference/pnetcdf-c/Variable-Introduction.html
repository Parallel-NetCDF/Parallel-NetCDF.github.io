<p>Variables for a netCDF file are defined when the dataset is
created, while the netCDF file is in define mode. Other variables
may be added later by reentering define mode. A netCDF variable has a
name, a type, and a shape, which are specified when it is defined. A
variable may also have values, which are established later in data
mode.
</p>
<p>Ordinarily, the name, type, and shape are fixed when the variable is
first defined. The name may be changed, but the type and shape of a
variable cannot be changed. However, a variable defined in terms of
the unlimited dimension can grow without bound in that dimension.
</p>
<p>A netCDF variable in an opened netCDF file is referred to by a small
integer called a variable ID.
</p>
<p>Variable IDs reflect the order in which variables were defined within
a netCDF file. Variable IDs are 0, 1, 2,..., in the order in which
the variables were defined. A function is available for getting the
variable ID from the variable name and vice-versa.
</p>
<p>Attributes (see <a href="Attributes.html#Attributes">Attributes</a>) may be associated with a variable to
specify such properties as units.
</p>
<p>Operations supported on variables are:
</p><ul>
<li> Create a variable, given its name, data type, and shape.

</li><li> Get a variable ID from its name.

</li><li> Get a variable&rsquo;s name, data type, shape, and number of attributes from
its ID.

</li><li> Put a data value into a variable, given variable ID, indices, and
value.

</li><li> Put an array of values into a variable, given variable ID, corner
indices, edge lengths, and a block of values.

</li><li> Put a subsampled or mapped array-section of values into a variable,
given variable ID, corner indices, edge lengths, stride vector, index
mapping vector, and a block of values.

</li><li> Get a data value from a variable, given variable ID and indices.

</li><li> Get an array of values from a variable, given variable ID, corner
indices, and edge lengths.

</li><li> Get a subsampled or mapped array-section of values from a variable,
given variable ID, corner indices, edge lengths, stride vector, and
index mapping vector.

</li><li> Rename a variable.
</li></ul>
