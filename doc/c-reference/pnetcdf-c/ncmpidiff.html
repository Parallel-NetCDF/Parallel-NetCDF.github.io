<p><b>ncmpidiff</b> is a parallel utility program that compares the contents of the
two files and reports the difference to the standard output. When comparing
file headers, the differences of all metadata are reported, including dimensions,
attributes, variable types and dimensionality. When comparing variables, only
the indices of first array element found differently is reported when option
<b>-t</b> is not used.  When option <b>-t</b> is used, it reports the element with
the largest difference that fails to meet the tolerance requirements.
</p>
<p>When comparing two files entirely, <b>ncmpidiff</b> skips the gaps between header
and variables and gaps between any two consecutive variables. Note this
behavior differs from the Unix command <b>diff</b> which compares two files byte
by byte.
</p>
<p>The gaps occur when the alignment feature is enabled when creating a new file,
which allows to allocate a larger space for the file header and aligns the
starting file offsets of fixed-size variables to a user specified file offset
boundary(see <a href="ncmpi_005f_005fenddef.html#ncmpi_005f_005fenddef">ncmpi__enddef</a> and <a href="PNETCDF_005fHINTS.html#PNETCDF_005fHINTS">PNETCDF_HINTS</a>). Oftentimes, the
contents of gaps are arbitrary. Thus, it is possible that two netCDF files of
same or different sizes are reported identical by <b>ncmpidiff</b> but not by
<b>diff</b>.
</p>
<a name="cdfdiff"></a><p><b>cdfdiff</b> is a serial version of <b>ncmpidiff</b>. It can be
compiled by gcc without MPI compiler. Thus, it can be useful to run on login
nodes in a cross-compile environment.

<h3 class="heading">Command-line Options</h3>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>-b</code></dt>
<dd><p>Verbose mode - print results (same or different) for all  components (file,
header, or variables) in comparison
</p></dd>
<dt><code>-q</code></dt>
<dd><p>Quiet mode - print nothing when two components in comparison are the same
</p></dd>
<dt><code>-h</code></dt>
<dd><p>Compare file header only
</p></dd>
<dt><code>-v var1,...,varn</code></dt>
<dd><p>Compare only the given list of variables, with names separated by comma and no
space in between (file header comparison is skipped, unless -h is used.)
</p></dd>
<dt><code>-t diff,ratio</code></dt>
<dd><p>Compare variables elementwisely with tolerance (diff and ratio separated by
comma without space). <strong>diff</strong> is the absolute value of element-wise
difference of any two variables. <strong>ratio</strong> is the relative element-wise
ratio, for instance, MAX(x,y) / MIN(x,y) - 1, where x is an array element from
a variable in the first file and y is the corresponding array element of the
same variable in the second file. Note when this option is used, the comparison
will compare the entire variables and reports the array indices of element with
the largest difference that fails to meet the both tolerance requirements.
(This option was first added in version 1.12.0.)
