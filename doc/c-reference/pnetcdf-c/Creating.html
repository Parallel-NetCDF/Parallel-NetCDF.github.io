<a name="index-creating-a-new-netCDF-file"></a>

<p>Here is a typical sequence of PnetCDF calls to create a new netCDF file:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">ncmpi_create                     /* create netCDF file and enter define mode (collective) */
       ...
ncmpi_def_dim                    /* define dimensions: from name and length (collective) */
       ...
ncmpi_def_var                    /* define variables: from name, type, ... (collective) */
       ...
ncmpi_put_att                    /* put attribute: assign attribute values (collective) */
       ...
ncmpi_enddef                     /* end definitions: leave define mode (collective) */
       ...
ncmpi_put_var<var>&lt;kind&gt;</var>_<var>&lt;type&gt;</var>_all   /* (collectively) write values of a variable (collective) */
       ...
ncmpi_begin_indep_data           /* enter independent data mode (collective) */
       ...
ncmpi_put_var<var>&lt;kind&gt;</var>_<var>&lt;type&gt;</var>       /* write values of a variable (independent) */
       ...
ncmpi_end_indep_data             /* exiting independent data mode (collective) */
       ...
ncmpi_close                      /* close: save new netCDF file (collective) */
</pre></div>

<p>Only one call is needed to create a netCDF file, at which point you
will be in the first of two netCDF modes. When accessing an open
netCDF file, it is in either define mode or data mode. In define
mode, you can create dimensions, variables, and new attributes, but
you cannot read or write variable data. In data mode, you can access
data and change existing attributes, but you are not permitted to
create new dimensions, variables, or attributes.
</p>
<p>One call to ncmpi_def_dim is needed for each dimension
created. Similarly, one call to ncmpi_def_var is needed for each variable
creation, and one call to a member of the ncmpi_put_att family is needed
for each attribute defined and assigned a value. To leave define mode
and enter data mode, call ncmpi_enddef.
</p>
<p>Once in data mode, you can add new data to variables, change old
values, and change values of existing attributes (so long as the
attribute changes do not require more storage space). Single values
may be written to a netCDF variable with one of the members of the
ncmpi_put_var1 family, depending on what type of data you have to
write. All the values of a variable may be written at once with one of
the members of the ncmpi_put_var family. Arrays or array cross-sections
of a variable may be written using members of the ncmpi_put_vara
family. Subsampled array sections may be written using members of the
ncmpi_put_vars family. Mapped array sections may be written using members
of the ncmpi_put_varm family. (Subsampled and mapped access are general
forms of data access that are explained later.)
</p>
<p>Finally, you should explicitly close all netCDF files that have
been opened for writing by calling ncmpi_close. PnetCDF might cache file
header locally. If a program terminates
abnormally with netCDF files open for writing, your most recent
modifications may be lost.
