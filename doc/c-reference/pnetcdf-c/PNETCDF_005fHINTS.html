<p>Starting from release of 1.4.0 version, this environment variable allows users
to pass I/O hints to PnetCDF library.  Hints can be a combination of both
PnetCDF and MPI-IO hints.
</p>
<p>The value is a string of hints separated by &quot;;&quot; and each hint is in the form of &quot;hint=value&quot;. E.g. under csh/tcsh environment, use command:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">setenv PNETCDF_HINTS &quot;romio_ds_write=disable;nc_header_align_size=1048576&quot;
</pre></div>
<p>Under bash environment, use command:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">export PNETCDF_HINTS=&quot;romio_ds_write=disable;nc_header_align_size=1048576&quot;
</pre></div>

<p>Note the environment variables precede the (hint) values set in the application
program, i.e. through MPI info object passed to See <a href="ncmpi_005fcreate.html#ncmpi_005fcreate">ncmpi_create</a> and
See <a href="ncmpi_005fopen.html#ncmpi_005fopen">ncmpi_open</a>. Hints nc_header_align_size, nc_var_align_size, and
nc_record_align_size precede the arguments v_align and r_align passed to
See <a href="ncmpi_005f_005fenddef.html#ncmpi_005f_005fenddef">ncmpi__enddef</a>.

<h3 class="heading">Available PnetCDF hints</h3>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>nc_header_align_size</code></dt>
<dd><p>(Before version 1.4.0)
It aligns the size of header extent of a newly created file.
This hint was first introduced in version 1.1.0, but can only be passed to
PnetCDF through an MPI info object, rather than setting the environment
variable PNETCDF_HINTS.
</p>
<p>(Between version 1.4.0 and 1.13.0)
It aligns the size of header extent of a newly created file. The default is 512
bytes. If the file striping size is known and the total size of all fixed-size
variables is larger than 4 times the file striping size, then this hint will be
set to the file striping size, i.e. the size of header extent will be the
smallest multiple of striping size that is larger than the file header size.
Set the value to 1 to disable the alignment.
</p>
<p>(Version 1.13.0 and later)
Starting from 1.13.0, the file striping size is no longer used to set the
file header extent. This is because it can result in a large header extent
than wanted, especially when the file striping size is large, e.g. 16 MB, and
the header size is much smaller, e.g. less than 1 MB.
</p></dd>
<dt><code>nc_var_align_size</code></dt>
<dd><p>(Before version 1.4.0)
It aligns the size of header extent of a newly created file.
This hint was first introduced in version 1.1.0, but can only be passed to
PnetCDF through an MPI info object, rather than setting the environment
variable PNETCDF_HINTS.
</p>
<p>(Between version 1.4.0 and 1.13.0)
This hint aligns the starting file offsets of individual fixed-size variables.
In PnetCDF version 1.10.0 and prior, the default is 512 bytes if file striping
size is not obtainable by PnetCDF. If the file striping size is known and the
total size of all fixed-size variables is larger than 4 times the file striping
size, then the starting file offsets of all individual fixed-size variables are
aligned to the file striping size, i.e. the smallest multiple of stripe size
that is larger than the end offset of the variable defined immediately prior to
this variable. Set the value to 1 to disable the alignment. Starting from
version 1.11.0, the default has changed to 1, i.e. no alignment. If
applications use PnetCDF nonblocking APIs to aggregate write requests to
multiple variables, then the best practice is to disable the alignment.
Disabling this alignment will prevent creating gaps in file space between two
consecutive variables and thus the writes to file system can be contiguous.
</p>
<p>(Version 1.13.0 and later)
Starting from version 1.13.0, this hint will only align the starting offset of
the entire data section, rather than individual fixed-size variables.
</p></dd>
<dt><code>nc_header_read_chunk_size</code></dt>
<dd><p>(version 1.4.0 and later)
PnetCDF reads the file headers in chunks. This hint indicates the chunk size
(in bytes). The default is 256 KB.
</p></dd>
<dt><code>nc_record_align_size</code></dt>
<dd><p>(version 1.5.0 and later)
This hint aligns the starting file offset of the record variable section. Note
this is for the entire section, not individual records.
</p></dd>
<dt><code>pnetcdf_subfiling</code></dt>
<dd><p>(version 1.6.0 and later)
This hint enables or disables the subfiling feature.  Its string value is
either &quot;enable&quot; or &quot;disable&quot;.
</p></dd>
<dt><code>nc_in_place_swap</code></dt>
<dd><p>(version 1.10.0 and later)
This hint enables or disables in-place byte swap on Little Endian
architectures.  When the hint is set to &quot;enable&quot;, PnetCDF performs byte swap on
user I/O buffers whenever possible. This option results in the least amount of
internal memory usage. However, if an immutable user buffer is used,
segmentation fault may occur when byte swap is performed on user buffer in
place.  When the hint is set to &quot;disabled&quot;, PnetCDF allocates an internal
buffer for byte swap without altering the contents of user buffer, when byte
swap is required.  This option will increase internal memory footprint.  When
the hint is set to &quot;auto&quot;, PnetCDF allocates an internal buffer for byte swap
only when the I/O request size is less than 4 KiB. For larger requests, user
buffers are used for in-place byte swap.  Note this hint takes effect only on
Little Endian machines, as no byte swap is necessary on Big Endian machines.
</p></dd>
<dt><code>nc_ibuf_size</code></dt>
<dd><p>(version 1.11.0 and later)
It sets the size of a temporal buffer to be allocated by PnetCDF internally to
pack noncontiguous user write buffers supplied to the nonblocking requests into
a contiguous space. Similarly for read case to unpack the temporal buffer to
user read buffers if they are noncontiguous. This affects both blocking and
nonblocking APIs. On some systems, using noncontiguous user buffers in MPI
collective read/write functions performs significantly worse than using
contiguous buffers. Note if the size of aggregated user buffers is larger than
<tt>nc_ibuf_size</tt>, packing/unpacking will be disabled to save memory footprint.
The default value is 16 MiB.
