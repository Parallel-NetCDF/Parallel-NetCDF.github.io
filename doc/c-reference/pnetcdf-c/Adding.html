<p>An existing netCDF file can be extensively altered. New dimensions,
variables, and attributes can be added or existing ones renamed, and
existing attributes can be deleted. Existing dimensions, variables,
and attributes can be renamed. The following code template lists a
typical sequence of calls to add new netCDF components to an existing
file:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">    ncmpi_open             /* open existing netCDF file */
      ...
    ncmpi_redef            /* put it into define mode */
        ...
      ncmpi_def_dim        /* define additional dimensions (if any) */
        ...
      ncmpi_def_var        /* define additional variables (if any) */
        ...
      ncmpi_put_att        /* define additional attributes (if any) */
        ...
    ncmpi_enddef           /* check definitions, leave define mode */
        ...
      ncmpi_put_var        /* provide values for new variables */
        ...
    ncmpi_close            /* close netCDF file */
</pre></div>

<p>A netCDF file is first opened by the ncmpi_open call. This call puts
the opened file in data mode, which means existing data values can be
accessed and changed, existing attributes can be changed (so long as
they do not grow), but nothing can be added. To add new netCDF
dimensions, variables, or attributes you must enter define mode, by
calling ncmpi_redef. In define mode, call ncmpi_def_dim to define new
dimensions, ncmpi_def_var to define new variables, and a member of the
ncmpi_put_att family to assign new attributes to variables or enlarge old
attributes.
</p>
<p>You can leave define mode and reenter data mode, checking all the new
definitions for consistency and committing the changes to disk, by
calling ncmpi_enddef. If you do not wish to reenter data mode, just call
ncmpi_close, which will have the effect of first calling ncmpi_enddef.
</p>
<p>Until the ncmpi_enddef call, you may back out of all the redefinitions
made in define mode and restore the previous state of the netCDF
file by calling ncmpi_abort. You may also use the ncmpi_abort call to
restore the netCDF file to a consistent state if the call to
ncmpi_enddef fails. If you have called ncmpi_close from definition mode and
the implied call to ncmpi_enddef fails, ncmpi_abort will automatically be
called to close the netCDF file and leave it in its previous
consistent state (before you entered define mode).
