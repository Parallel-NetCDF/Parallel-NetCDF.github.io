<h2 id="OldFormat">Old Format</h2>
<p>
The <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/old_docs/really_old/guide_15.html">CDF-1</a> file format is the default file format which has been in use through netCDF library version 3.5.1.   The definitive resource for these limits can be found at Unidata's <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/file_structure_and_performance.html#classic_format_limitations">NetCDF Classic Format Limitations</a> page.
</p>
<h2 id="ExtendingLimits">Extending Limits</h2>
<p>
The <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/file_format_specifications.html">CDF-2</a> file format (a.k.a. the 64-bit offset format) relaxes many of the above limitations.  In order to create a CDF-2 formatted file, you must pass the flag NC_64BIT_OFFSET when creating the file.  PnetCDF supports the CDF-2 file format as well, though shares the same limits as serial NetCDF.  Read more at <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/">Unidata</a>'s <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/file_structure_and_performance.html#offset_format_limitations">64-bit Offset Format Limitations</a> page for limitations on the number of variables allowable per file, maximum sizes of record and non-record variables, and exceptions. The limitations and exceptions are quoted here.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Although the 64-bit offset format allows the creation of much larger netCDF files than was possible with the classic format, there are still some restrictions on the size of variables.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
It's important to note that without Large File Support (LFS) in the operating system, it's impossible to create any file larger than 2 GiBytes. Assuming an operating system with LFS, the following restrictions apply to the netCDF 64-bit offset format.
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
No fixed-size variable can require more than (2<sup>32</sup> - 4) bytes (i.e. 4GiB - 4 bytes, or 4,294,967,292 bytes) of storage for its data, unless it is the last fixed-size variable and there are no record variables. When there are no record variables, the last fixed-size variable can be any size supported by the file system, e.g. terabytes.
A 64-bit offset format netCDF file can have up to (2<sup>32</sup> - 1) fixed sized variables, each under 4GiB in size. If there are no record variables in the file the last fixed variable can be any size.
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
No record variable can require more than (2<sup>32</sup> - 4) bytes of storage for each record's worth of data, unless it is the last record variable. A 64-bit offset format netCDF file can have up to (2<sup>32</sup> - 1) records, of up to (2<sup>32</sup> - 1) variables, as long as the size of one record's data for each record variable except the last is less than 4 GiB - 4.
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
Note also that all netCDF variables and records are padded to 4 byte boundaries.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The <a href="../doc/c-reference/pnetcdf-c/CDF_002d5-file-format-specification.html">CDF-5</a> file format further relaxes the limitation to allow large dimensions (i.e. &gt; 2<sup>32</sup>) and more large variables. To create a CDF-5 file, the file create mode NC_64BIT_DATA must be used when calling ncmpi_create function. Please note that <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/">Unidata</a>'s NetCDF has also started to support CDF-5 format since its release of version 4.4.0.
</p>
<h2 id="Recordvs.Non-RecordVariables">Record vs. Non-Record Variables</h2>
<p>
One subtle point about the CDF file format limitations is that record
variables (those with one NC_UNLIMITED dimension) can be quite large.  The
product of the fixed-sized dimensions of a record variable defines the size of
a single record.  There can be quite a few of these records in a record
variable, though, so that can be one way around the file format limitations on
record size.
</p>
<p>
The drawback of using record variables is that with multiple record variables,
the data for each variable are interleaved on a per-record basis.  This data
layout makes it much harder to figure out the optimal access pattern.
Ideally, though, programs would read and write record variables one record at
a time.
</p>
<h2 id="AmountofIndividualRequestsisLimitedto2GB">Amount of Individual Requests is Limited to 2GB</h2>
<p>
In PnetCDF, a single get/put request is limited to the amount of 2GiB.
First, the MPI standard specifies that the 'count' argument passed to MPI read and write APIs be a 32-bit signed integer and hence the upper bound of 2<sup>31</sup> elements.
Secondly, ROMIO (the MPI-I/O implementation used by almost all MPI libraries) further limits the request amount to 2<sup>31</sup> bytes. Future release of ROMIO may fix this problem.
A solution for PnetCDF users is to break the request to multiple get/put calls so that each is less than amount of 2 GiB.
