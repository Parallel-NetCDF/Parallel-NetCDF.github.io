<center> <h2>PnetCDF and NetCDF-4</h2> </center>
<hr>

A brief history: In the fall of 2008, UCAR released NetCDF4, which took the
HDF5 file format and features, and put the serial netCDF interface on top of
that.  UCAR modified the serial netCDF API to expose some of the new features
HDF5 introduced, including a means for parallel I/O.
</p>

<p>
Some software engineering gave NetCDF-4 the concept of a separation between
interface and file format (netCDF API, legacy netCDF or new HDF5 file format).
Soon, UCAR extended this interface and gave NetCDF-4 the ability to use
PnetCDF.   Now, with some caveats, the classic netCDF API can read and write
the classic netCDF file format either using the classic netCDF library or our
PnetCDF library.  </p>
<p>
We think this is terrific, and in no way has UCAR usurped or challenged PnetCDF
with this move. Instead, UCAR has provided a valuable option to applications
developers.  In order to transition to parallel I/O, the typical "file per
process" or "all I/O from rank 0" approaches need to be re-thought, no matter
which underlying library will carry out the I/O.  Applications accustomed to
serial netCDF can try out PnetCDF while still using an API familiar to them.
If they want to use some of the more sophisticated PnetCDF features, or try out
PnetCDF down the road, only minor edits to the names of the functions will be
needed -- the application has already done the hard work of domain
decomposition.  </p>

<h2 id="InteroperabilityofPnetCDFwithnetCDF-4">Interoperability of PnetCDF with netCDF-4</h2>
<p>
Starting from version 4.2.1.1, netCDF-4 program can perform parallel I/O on the
classic CDF-1 and CDF-2 files through PnetCDF. Starting from version 4.4.0, the
CDF-5 format is supported. This is done by passing file create mode NC_PNETCDF to
nc_create_par(), for instance, </p>
<pre>
nc_create_par(filename, NC_PNETCDF|NC_64BIT_OFFSET, MPI_COMM_WORLD, info, &amp;ncid);
</pre>
creates a file in CDF-2 format.<p>
Check the <a href="http://cucis.ece.northwestern.edu/projects/PnetCDF/#InteroperabilityWithNetCDF4">netCDF-4 example programs</a> in C and Fortran.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> Currently, using PnetCDF mode is the only way for a
netCDF program to perform parallel I/O on files in classic CDF-1, 2, and 5
formats.  </p>
