				<h1 id="MPI-IOhintsforPnetCDF">MPI-IO hints for PnetCDF</h1>
<p>
PnetCDF sits on top of MPI-IO, allowing us to use MPI Info objects to tune behavior. This page gives some more information about the way PnetCDF uses MPI Info objects, and also some situations where hints have proven useful. 
</p>
<h2 id="MPIInfoandPnetCDFAPI">MPI Info and PnetCDF API</h2>
<p>
The PnetCDF routines <tt>ncmpi_create</tt>, <tt>ncmpi_open</tt>, <tt>nfmpi_create</tt>, and <tt>nfmpi_open</tt> take a hint
parameter. That parameter is usually MPI_INFO_NULL, which in most cases is just fine. 
</p>
<p>
If you create an MPI-IO Info, and set it up with some "hints", then
you can direct the MPI implementation to perhaps take a different
action.  Implementations can ignore MPI-IO hints, so if you are
running on an implementation that does not understand a particular
hint, that's ok. 
</p>
<h2 id="PnetCDFHints">PnetCDF Hints</h2>
<p>
Below is the list of hints that recognized by PnetCDF.
</p>
<ul><li>"nc_header_align_size" -- aligns the header size of a newly created file. The default is 512 bytes if file striping size is unknown. If the file striping size is know and the aggregate variable size is larger than 4 times the file striping size, the default is set to the file striping size.
</li><li>"nc_var_align_size" --  aligns the starting file offsets of each non-record variable. The default is 512 bytes if file striping size is unknown. If the file striping size is know and the aggregate variable size is larger than 4 times the file striping size, the default is set to the file striping size.
</li><li>"nc_header_read_chunk_size" -- PnetCDF reads the file headers in chunks. This hint indicates the chunk size (in bytes). The default is 256 KB.
</li><li>"nc_record_align_size" -- aligns the starting file offset of the record variable section. Note this is for the entire section, not individual records.
</li></ul><h2 id="UsingMPIInfoobjects">Using MPI Info objects</h2>
<p>
At a high-level, here's how PnetCDF uses MPI Info objects
Here's how you might be able to use hints in your code.  
</p>
<ol><li>create an info object
</li><li>set hints
</li><li>pass the hints to create/open
</li></ol><h2 id="UsefulHints">Useful Hints</h2>
<p>
On the Lustre file system, especially on Cray systems, we've seen quite high file locking costs.  For some workloads, the optimizations for noncontiguous access might actually prove to be slower.  
</p>
<ul><li>set "romio_ds_read" "disable"
</li><li>set "romio_ds_write" "disable"
</li></ul><p>
or 
</p>
<ul><li>try setting "ind_wr_buffer_size" to "16777216"
</li></ul><h2 id="Examples">Examples</h2>
