<center> <h2>PnetCDF - File Header and Variable File Layout Alignment</h2> </center>
<hr>

From the beginning, PnetCDF has taken an MPI INFO object in the file create
and open routines.  This object has to this point been used to pass hints down
to the MPI-IO layer, but nothing precluded using those hint objects at the
PnetCDF layer.  We added a new feature in <a href="/projects/parallel-netcdf/wiki/ReleaseNotes-1.1.0">1.1.0</a> that uses these
MPI info hints to align the space allocated for file header and the starting file offsets of the non-record variables.
</p>
<p>
Two PnetCDF hints that can be used to control the alignment are "nc_header_align_size" and
"nc_var_align_size". The former aligns the header size of a newly created file.
The latter, "nc_var_align_size", is used to align the starting file offsets
of all non-record variables. (The alignment for record variables is currently in our todo list.)
</p>
<h2 id="Usageexamples">Usage examples</h2>
<pre>
   MPI_Info_set(info, "nc_header_align_size", "1048576");
   MPI_Info_set(info, "nc_var_align_size",    "4194304");
   ncmpi_create(MPI_COMM_WORLD, "filename.nc", mode, info, &amp;ncid);
</pre><h2 id="Defaultvalues">Default values</h2>
<p>
The performance of PnetCDF can be significantly affected by the alignment, especially
when the aggregate I/O request amounts are large. On parallel file systems, setting the
hints equal to the file system striping size often results in the best performance.
Default values of the two alignment hints are calculated below.
If the MPI-IO hint "striping_unit" is larger than zero (set by the user or obtained from the
file system) and the total size of all non-record/record variables is lager than N * striping_unit,
then the default for both hints are set to striping_unit. (Currently, N=4.)
Otherwise, the default is 512 bytes.
</p>
<p>
The alignment can be disabled by setting both hints to "1".
</p>
<h2 id="Whyusenc_header_align_sizehint">Why use "nc_header_align_size" hint?</h2>
<p>
This hint allows some extra space between the end of the header
describing the entire file and the first variable.  If you
have an application that periodically wishes to add more variables to an
already existing file, expanding the file header size may result in an expensive
move of the entire data file to make room for the definition of the new variables.
Hence, setting this hint to a value that is big enough to accommodate any
additional variables means you may leave your application code as-is and
yet still see tremendous performance improvements.
</p>
<h2 id="Whyusenc_var_align_sizehint">Why use "nc_var_align_size" hint?</h2>
<p>
If you are writing to a block-based parallel file system, such as IBM's
GPFS or Lustre, then an application write becomes a block write at the file system
layer.  If a write straddles two blocks, then locks must be acquired for both
blocks.  Aligning the start of a variable to a block boundary, combined with
collective I/O optimizations in the MPI-IO library can often eliminate all
unaligned file system accesses.
</p>
<p>
If you are using independent APIs, then setting this hint is more important than if using collective.
This is because most of the latest MPI-IO implementations have incorporated the file access alignment in their collective I/O functions, if MPI-IO can successfully retrieve the file striping information from the underlying parallel file system.
This is another reason we encourage PnetCDF users to use collective APIs whenever possible.
</p>
<h2 id="Whytwoseparatehints">Why two separate hints?</h2>
<p>
Note that the two alignment hints can be set at the same time, with different values.
When this happens, the starting file offset of the first variable will be set to
a number that is a multiple of both hint values. Setting different values may be
useful in two scenarios:
1) when a file has a large header and small-sized non-record variables, and
2) a small header and large-sized non-record variables.
</p>
<h2 id="Examplescenarios">Example scenarios</h2>
<p>
Alignment for file system:  Argonne's BlueGene system has a GPFS file system
with a 4MB block size (striping_unit).  By setting the "nc_var_align_size" hint to 4MB, PnetCDF
will round up the starting offset of each non-record variable to the next 4MB.
</p>
<p>
Padding header for future growth:  An application creates a checkpoint file,
but has structured the code so that each component writes its own information
to the checkpoint file.  Since we don't know 100% of the information at the
initial define mode time, this application has to call <tt>ncmpi_redef()</tt> for each
component.  If this call results in a bigger header on disk, then PnetCDF
initiates a very expensive data movement step. However, the application
could make use of the header alignment hint to ensure there is
enough room for the header to grow and accommodate additional variables.
</p>
<h2 id="Limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>
This hint will have no impact on the alignment of record variables.  I (robl)
tried but could not get the correctness tests to pass.  Patches welcome!
