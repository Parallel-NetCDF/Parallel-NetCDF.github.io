[PnetCDF](https://parallel-netcdf.github.io) Version 1.14.0 Release Notes (November 11, 2024)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* New features
  + Intra-node aggregation for write requests -- When the number of MPI
    processes allocated to a compute node is large, this feature can
    effectively reduce the communication congestion caused by an overwhelming
    large number of asynchronous messages posted during the collective write
    of MPI-IO. This new feature can be enabled by setting the PnetCDF I/O hint
    'nc_num_aggrs_per_node' to the desired number of aggregators per compute
    node. The non-aggregators send their requests to the assigned aggregators,
    and then the aggregators make aggregated requests to the file.
    [PR #156](https://github.com/Parallel-NetCDF/PnetCDF/pull/156).
  + Support MPI derived data types that are constructed from the large-count
    derived datatype constructors introduced in MPI 4.0.
    [PR #145](https://github.com/Parallel-NetCDF/PnetCDF/pull/145).

* New optimization
  + When running sequentially (i.e. number of processes is 1), PnetCDF calls
    the MPI independent I/O functions and avoids calls to MPI_Barrier,
    MPI_Bcast, and MPI_Allreduce.
    [PR #149](https://github.com/Parallel-NetCDF/PnetCDF/pull/149).

* Configure options changed
  + The default has been changed to build both shared and static libraries.
    [PR #143](https://github.com/Parallel-NetCDF/PnetCDF/pull/143).

* Configure updates:
  + Fix `pnetcdf-config` of reflecting the installation path when installation
    is done by running command `make install DESTDIR=/alternate/directory`
    which prepends '/alternate/directory' before all installation names.
    [PR #154](https://github.com/Parallel-NetCDF/PnetCDF/pull/154).

* New constants
  + A new C macro `NC_FillValue` replaces `_FillValue` and thus `_FillValue` is
    now deprecated This conforms with NetCDF4's change in its version 4.9.3
    release. [PR #153](https://github.com/Parallel-NetCDF/PnetCDF/pull/153).

* New PnetCDF hints
  + 'nc_num_aggrs_per_node' -- To enable the intra-node aggregation, this I/O
    hint can set to a positive integral value, which indicates the desired
    number of processes per compute node to be selected as the aggregators.
    Setting it to 0 disables the aggregation, which is also the default mode.
    [PR #156](https://github.com/Parallel-NetCDF/PnetCDF/pull/156).

* Build recipes
  + When using OpenMPI on Mac OSX, a link error may appear. The work around is
    to add `LDFLAGS=-ld_classic` into the configure command line. Thanks to
    Rui Chen for reporting and provide the solution.
    [Issue #139](https://github.com/Parallel-NetCDF/PnetCDF/issues/139).

* Updated utility programs
  + none

* Other updates:
  + More document for comparing PnetCDF and NetCDF4 has been added to file
    doc/netcdf4_vs_pnetcdf.md
    [PR #152](https://github.com/Parallel-NetCDF/PnetCDF/pull/152) and
    [PR #140](https://github.com/Parallel-NetCDF/PnetCDF/pull/140).

* New example programs
  + C/flexible_bottom.c and C/vard_bottom.c - These two examples construct MPI
    derived data types using absolute memory addresses first and use MPI_BOTTOM
    when calling the PnetCDF flexible APIs.

* New programs for I/O benchmarks
  + C/pnetcdf_put_vara.c --
    * This program writes a series of 3D variables with 2D block-block
      partitioning pattern. Each variable is a record variable.
      [PR #150](https://github.com/Parallel-NetCDF/PnetCDF/pull/150).
  + C/netcdf_put_vara.c --
    * This sequential NetCDF-C program writes a series of 3D variables. Each
      variable is a record variable.
    * This program and `C/pnetcdf_put_vara.c` can be used to compare the
      performance of NetCDF and PnetCDF when running sequentially, i.e. one
      process.
      [PR #150](https://github.com/Parallel-NetCDF/PnetCDF/pull/150).

* New test program
  + test/testcases/flexible_large_count.c - tests flexible APIs that use MPI
    derived datatypes created by MPI large-count datatype constructors.
    [PR #145](https://github.com/Parallel-NetCDF/PnetCDF/pull/145).
