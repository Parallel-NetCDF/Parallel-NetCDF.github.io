[PnetCDF](https://parallel-netcdf.github.io) Version 1.12.1 Release Notes (December 9, 2019)

* New/updated utility program
  + A new command-line option `-t` is added to utility program `cdfdiff` to
    compare variable differences within a tolerance. See the man page of
    `cdfdiff` for usage.

* Issues related to MPI library vendors:
  + When using OpenMPI version 4.0.2 to build PnetCDF 1.12.0 and prior
    versions, running 'make' may encounter a problem related to MPI constants
    that have been deprecated in MPI standard 3.0. Error messages similar to
    below may appear.

    ```
    In OpenMPI 4.0.2, the default configuration is not to support MPI constants
    that have been deprecated in MPI 3.0. However, instead of ignoring those
    constants, OpenMPI 4.0.2 still defines them as assertion macros, which can
    cleverly trigger a compile-time error if user programs try to use them.
    This behavior appears when the underlying C compilers supporting 2011
    revision of the C standard (with `__STDC_VERSION__ >= 201112L`) such as GCC
    version 4.6 and later are used to build OpenMPI. However, when using
    earlier versions of C compilers to build OpenMPI 4.0.2, those deprecated
    MPI constants are not defined at all in mpi.h. See discussion
    [issue 7099](https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi/issues/7099).

    Thanks to Carl Ponder for reporting the error and Nick Papior for providing
    a workaround solution that is to rebuild OpenMPI 4.0.2 with configure
    option "--enable-mpi1-compatibility" and use it to build PnetCDF 1.12.0 and
    earlier versions. Note the latest MPICH 3.3.1 does not have such an issue,
    as all deprecated constants are still defined. This issue is now fixed in
    PnetCDF of release 1.12.1 which no longer requires the workaround build of
    OpenMPI.

* Bug fixes
  + Fix strict aliasing bug when building PnetCDF with -O3 flag. See
    [a40aa5f](https://github.com/Parallel-NetCDF/PnetCDF/commit/a40aa5f73938ba1298f92ad471b3e3578ef8dbda)

* New Limitations
  + Configure command now checks whether the supplied MPI C compiler is a
    wrapper of a C++ compiler. If this is detected, the PnetCDF configuration
    will be aborted. This check is enforced because using such an MPI C
    compiler will cause problem for linking Fortran, C and C++ programs, with
    an error message similar to this:
    ```
    conftestf.o: In function `MAIN_': conftestf.f:4: undefined reference to `sub_'
    configure:33318: error: Could not link conftestf.o and conftest.o
    ```

* Build recipes
  + On Theta @ ALCF, when compiling utility programs 'ncoffsets' and 'cdfdiff',
    using Intel-based compilers such as module PrgEnv-intel, one may encounter
    error messages below.
    ```
    In file included from /usr/include/inttypes.h:27:0,
    /theta-archive/intel/compilers_and_libraries_2019.5.281/linux/compiler/include/stdint.h:43:54: error: missing binary operator before token "("
       defined(__has_include_next) && __has_include_next(<stdint.h>)
                                                        ^
    ```
    This issue is due to the environment variable 'CPATH' is set for Intel C
    compilers which is not compatible with GCC. However, this can be simply
    resolved by adding "SEQ_CC=icc" to your make command line, i.e.
    ```
    make SEQ_CC=icc
    ```

* Other updates:
  + The string length of I/O hint `nc_burst_buf_dirname`, the name of burst
    buffer directory must be less than the value of MPI_MAX_INFO_VAL. This is
    because all PnetCDF I/O hints were handled through MPI info mechanism and
    MPI requires the maximum string length of the value of an MPI info object
    to be MPI_MAX_INFO_VAL. If violated, error MPI_ERR_INFO_VALUE will be
    returned.
