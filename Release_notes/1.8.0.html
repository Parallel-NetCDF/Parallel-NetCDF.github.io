<center> <h2>PnetCDF 1.8.0 Release Notes</h2> </center>
<br>

Release Date: December 19, 2016
</p>

<h2 id="Newfeatures">New features</h2>
<ul><li>Copy fill values to data elements that cause out-of-bound error (i.e.
NC_ERANGE.) In netCDF v4.4.1 and priors, type conversion for out-of-
bound elements proceeds even if the out-of-bound error is detected, and
the contents (in both files and read buffers) are left up to the user
to handle. See the URL below for details.
<a class="ext-link" href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/group__error.html"><span class="icon">​</span>http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/group__error.html</a>
Instead of carrying out the type conversion, PnetCDF fills the out-of-
bound data elements with their "fill values", as specified by the
variable's attribute "_FillValue" or default CDF fill values if the
attribute is not defined. Specifically, for PnetCDF put APIs, the value
of attribute _FillValue, if defined, will be used when writing to files.
For get APIs, the default CDF _FillValue corresponding to the internal
data type will be used to fill the read buffer. This feature can be
disabled by adding option "--disable-erange-fill" to the configure
command line. In this case, the conventional NetCDF method described
above is used.
</li><li>A new configure option --enable-relax-coord-bound is added to provide a
more relaxed boundary check for argument start. Traditionally, both
NetCDF and PnetCDF detect the error code NC_EINVALCOORDS when the value
of start is larger than or equal to the defined dimension size. This can
be inconvenient for some applications that make a zero-length request
with start being the dimension size, usually the last process. The new
configure option relaxes the boundary check by allowing the above
exception, i.e. start[i] can be the size of dimension i only when
count[i] is zero. The default of this feature is disabled. For more
detailed information, see discussion in:
<a class="ext-link" href="http://lists.mcs.anl.gov/pipermail/parallel-netcdf/2016-March/001839.html"><span class="icon">​</span>http://lists.mcs.anl.gov/pipermail/parallel-netcdf/2016-March/001839.html</a>
</li><li>New macros have been added to PnetCDF header file, pnetcdf.h, to indicate
the configurable options that were enabled/disabled. These macros are
PNETCDF_ERANGE_FILL, PNETCDF_SUBFILING, PNETCDF_RELAX_COORD_BOUND, and
PNETCDF_DEBUG_MODE. Their values are set to 1 when enabled, 0 otherwise.
</li><li>API ncmpi_inq_file_format can now detect HDF5 file signature and report
NC_FORMAT_NETCDF4.
</li><li>Enable ncmpidump to check whether input file is in HDF5 format when -k
option is used at the command line.
</li><li>In ncmpi_open, add a checking for HDF5 file signature and return error
code NC_ENOTNC3 if detected.
</li></ul><h2 id="NewAPIs">New APIs</h2>
<ul><li>ncmpi_strerrno, nfmpi_strerrno, nf90mpi_strerrno return the string name
of a NC error code.
</li><li>ncmpi_inq_path, nfmpi_inq_path, nf90mpi_inq_path for inquiring the file
pathname which was used to open/create the CDF file.
</li></ul><h2 id="Newoptimization">New optimization</h2>
<ul><li>Use Bernstein hash function for checking whether the name of a variable
or dimension has already been used.
</li><li>Replace the use of linked lists with arrays for storing the pending
nonblocking requests. This could save time for traversing the linked
list.
</li></ul><h2 id="Syntaxchanges">Syntax changes</h2>
<ul><li>ncmpi_cancel can now be called in define mode.
</li></ul><h2 id="Semanticsupdates">Semantics updates</h2>
<ul><li>For collective APIs, the following errors are considered fatal:
NC_EBADID, NC_EPERM, NC_EINDEFINE, NC_EINDEP, and NC_ENOTINDEP. Once
detects these errors the calling APIs return immediately. If the fatal
errors happen only to a subset of processes, the running program may
hang, due to other processes being waiting at an MPI collective call.
(Note hanging will never occur to independent APIs.) To debug a hanging
problem, users can run the program in safe mode by setting the
environment variable PNETCDF_SAFE_MODE to 1. In safe mode, error codes
are synchronized among all processes. Error codes other than the above,
if detected, are not as fatal. The processes encountering the non-fatal
errors will continue to the collective call but with zero-length
requests. Thus, the collective calls can nicely complete without hanging.
</li><li>Consistency check for header data (defining dimensions, variables, and
attributes) is moved to individual APIs and only enabled when safe mode
is enabled. Header data consistency check is no longer performed in
ncmpi_enddef. As a reminder, PnetCDF APIs that change header data are
all collective and their arguments are required to be consistent among
the calling processes.
</li><li>In netCDF-3, whether the contents of an NC_BYTE variable in CDF-1 or
CDF-2 files are signed or unsigned is determined by the calling APIs. See
<a class="ext-link" href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/data_type.html#type_conversion"><span class="icon">​</span>http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/data_type.html#type_conversion</a>
"In netcdf-3, we treat NC_BYTE as signed for the purposes of conversion
to short, int, long, float, or double. (Of course, no conversion takes
place when the internal type is signed char.) In the _uchar functions, we
treat NC_BYTE as if it were unsigned. Thus, no NC_ERANGE error can occur
converting between NC_BYTE and unsigned char." In other words, if called
from signed APIs, NC_BYTE variables are treated as signed. If called from
unsigned APIs (i.e. _uchar APIs, the only unsigned APIs in netCDF-3) they
are unsigned. NetCDF-3 specifically makes an exception to skip NC_ERANGE
check when calling _uchar APIs on NC_BYTE variables. However, in netCDF-4
and CDF-5, because of the introduction of the new data type NC_UBYTE, an
unsigned 8-bit integer, which makes NC_BYTE an signed 8-bit integer and
thus renders the above exception less sense. Starting from this release,
for CDF-5 files, regular NC_ERANGE check is performed in PnetCDF for all
APIs that access NC_BYTE variables. For CDF-1 and 2 files, PnetCDF still
honors that exception.
</li><li>Prior to version 1.7.0, any outstanding nonblocking requests detected at
file close are automatically cancelled without reporting an error.
Starting from this 1.8.0 release, error code NC_EPENDING will be returned
when pending requests are detected at the file close.
</li><li>API ncmpi_set_default_format is changed to an independent API. However,
it is expected to be called by all processes that intend to create a file
later. Inconsistency in default format setting will be detected at file
create time.
</li></ul><h2 id="Newutilityprogram">New utility program</h2>
<ul><li>Added pnetcdf-config shell script to display the options used in building
PnetCDF.
</li></ul><h2 id="Newerrorcodeprecedence">New error code precedence</h2>
<ul><li>When two or more errors are detected by the PnetCDF library (e.g. due to
the use of more than one bad API argument), the error code returned from
an API will follow the precedence below. In principle, the errors related
to ncid is the most serious, followed by varid.
</li></ul><blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
For put attribute APIs:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
NC_EBADID, NC_EPERM, NC_ENOTVAR, NC_EBADNAME, NC_EBADTYPE, NC_ECHAR,
NC_EINVAL, NC_ENOTINDEFINE, NC_ERANGE
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
For get attribute APIs:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
NC_EBADID, NC_ENOTVAR, NC_EBADNAME, NC_ENOTATT, NC_ECHAR, NC_EINVAL,
NC_ERANGE
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
For put/get variable APIs:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
NC_EBADID, NC_EPERM, NC_EINDEFINE, NC_ENOTVAR, NC_ECHAR,
NC_EINVALCOORDS, NC_EEDGE, NC_ESTRIDE, NC_EINVAL, NC_ERANGE
</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Newerrorcode">New error code</h2>
<ul><li>NC_EPENDING: Pending nonblocking request is found at file close.
</li><li>NC_EINVAL_OMODE: invalid file open mode. This separates the case from the
file create API which uses NC_EINVAL_CMODE mode. The error messages for
both error codes are revised accordingly.
</li><li>NC_EMULTIDEFINE_CMODE: inconsistent file create mode. This separates the
case from NC_EMULTIDEFINE_OMODE. The error messages for both error codes
are revised accordingly.
</li><li>The Fortran error codes corresponding to the above are also added.
</li></ul><h2 id="Newtestprogram">New test program</h2>
<ul><li>test/testcases/scalar.c to test whether arguments start, count, stride,
and imap are properly ignored when getting/putting a scalar variable
</li><li>test/testcases/erange_fill.m4 to test the new configure-time feature of
--enable-erange-fill
</li></ul><h2 id="Otherupdates:">Other updates:</h2>
<ul><li>Check file open/create mode for NC_DISKLESS and NC_MMAP and return error
code NC_EINVAL_OMODE/NC_EINVAL_CMODE if either of these two modes is
used. These modes are currently not supported.
</li><li>Clarify support for CDF-2 and CDF-5 formats. When the size of MPI_Offset
is less than 8 bytes, support for CDF-2 and CDF-5 is disabled.
</li><li>When using OpenMPI 2.0.1 to build PnetCDF, users may encounter an error
message of "test_write.c: file ./scratch.nc should not exist" or "FAILURE
at line 429 of test_ncmpi_abort in test_write.c: expecting NC_ENOENT or
NC_EFILE but got NC_NOERR" while running "make check". The cause is due
to a bug in OpenMPI 2.0.1 that fails to return the correct MPI error
class MPI_ERR_NO_SUCH_FILE when deleting a non-existing file. The bug fix
will appear in OpenMPI 2.0.2. See the OpenMPI bug report in
<a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi/issues/2232"><span class="icon">​</span>https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi/issues/2232</a>
</li><li>When using OpenMPI 1.10.2 and 1.8.5 to build PnetCDF, users may encounter
an error message of "An error occurred in MPI_Type_create_hindexed" when
running "make check". This is due to a bug in OpenMPI that fails to
create a zero-size datatype in MPI_Type_create_hindexed. The bug fix has
appeared in the releases of 1.10.3, 1.8.6, and 2.0.1. See the bug report
in <a class="ext-link" href="https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi/issues/1611"><span class="icon">​</span>https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi/issues/1611</a>
</li><li>When using SGI MPI with MPT 2.14 to build PnetCDF, users may encounter an
error message of "function:MPI_TYPE_CREATE_HVECTOR, Invalid argument".
The bug fix will appear in 2.15 to be released in November 2016.
</li><li>The quiet mode of utility program ncmpidiff, command-line option -q, now
print no message when two files or two variables in comparison are the
same.
</li></ul><h2 id="InteroperabilitywithnetCDF-4">Interoperability with netCDF-4</h2>
<ul><li>When using 1.8.0 release to build netCDF version 4.4.1.1 and earlier,
users may encounter errors with message like "test_put.c: NetCDF: Numeric
conversion not representable" from running command "make test".  This is
due to an incorrect implementation of uchar APIs for accessing variables
of type NC_BYTE for CDF-2 files in both PnetCDF and NetCDF. If not using
such a special case, users can ignore this error. See more information
above under "Semantics updates".
</li></ul><h2 id="Bugfixes">Bug fixes</h2>
<ul><li>Fix to allow argument no_fill in API ncmpi_inq_var_fill to be NULL. See
<a class="changeset" href="/projects/parallel-netcdf/changeset/2609" title="argument no_fill can be NULL">r2609</a>
</li><li>Fix to allow putting global attribute _FillValue. See <a class="changeset" href="/projects/parallel-netcdf/changeset/2560" title="bug fix: allow put global attribute _FillValue">r2560</a>
</li><li>Fix some missing character string normalizations for names of attributes,
dimensions, and variables.
</li><li>Fix the return unlimited dimension ID of value -1, not 0, by Fortran API
nfmpi_inq_unlimdim when no unlimited dimension is defined. This conforms
with netCDF convention. See <a class="changeset" href="/projects/parallel-netcdf/changeset/2396" title="bug fix: dim ID returned by nfmpi_inq_unlimdim should be -1 when no ...">r2396</a> and <a class="changeset" href="/projects/parallel-netcdf/changeset/1372" title="according to netCDF, if no unlimited length dimension has been defined, -1 ...">r1372</a>
</li><li>Fix string processing of the environment variables for PnetCDF I/O hints
See <a class="changeset" href="/projects/parallel-netcdf/changeset/2385" title="bug fix: should not modify env string, do that on a copy of it">r2385</a>
</li><li>Fix utility ncmpidiff to use collective read APIs in collective data mode
See <a class="changeset" href="/projects/parallel-netcdf/changeset/2382" title="bug fix: should have use collective APIs">r2382</a>
