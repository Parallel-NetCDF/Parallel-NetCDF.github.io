[PnetCDF](https://parallel-netcdf.github.io) Version 1.12.2 Release Notes (January 15, 2021)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Build recipes
  + Starting from GNU Fortran 10.0.0, function/subroutine argument type
    mismatch becomes a compile error. A new compile command-line option
    "-fallow-argument-mismatch" can turn these errors into warnings. This
    command-line option is added automatically in PnetCDF version 1.12.2 and
    later. When building PnetCDF of version 1.12.1 and earlier versions using
    GNU Fortran 10.0.0 and later, please add "-fallow-argument-mismatch" to
    environment variables FFLAGS and FCFLAGS.
    See [issue #61](https://github.com/Parallel-NetCDF/PnetCDF/issues/61)
    and [GCC 10 Release note](https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-10/changes.html).
  + README.CRAY has been revised to reflect the recent changes of default
    compiling environment on Cori at NERSC.

* Updated utility program
  + ncvalidator now reports the name of variable that violates the NetCDF
    limitation on large variables for CDF-2 files
  + add corrupted file bad_large_fixed_var.nc2 that contains one large
    fixed-size variables that is not defined last
  + add corrupted file bad_large_rec_2_vars.nc2 that contains 2 large record
    variables
  + add corrupted file bad_large_rec_var.nc2 that contains 1 large record
    variable that is not defined last
  + add URLs of NetCDF limitations on large variables for CDF-1 and 2 file
    formats

* Other updates:
  + When calling ncmpi_create() with NC_CLOBBER flag, PnetCDF now calls
    access() to check whether file exists first. If the file does not exist,
    successive calls to truncate() or unlink() can be skipped.
  + Improve detection of HDF5 signature. The HDF5 signature is located at the
    beginning of the HDF5 superblock, but the location of HDF5 superblock may
    not be at the beginning of the file. It is located at byte offset 0, byte
    offset 512, and at successive locations in the file, each a multiple of two
    of the previous location; in other words, at these byte offsets: 0, 512,
    1024, 2048, and so on.

* Bug fixes
  + Fix more strict aliasing bug when building PnetCDF with -O3 flag. Thanks to
    Gianfranco Costamagna for reporting
    [issue #55](https://github.com/Parallel-NetCDF/PnetCDF/issues/55). See
    [pull request r65](https://github.com/Parallel-NetCDF/PnetCDF/pull/65) for
    the fix.
  + Fix NC_CLOBBER mode for ncmpi_create() when files are existing symbolic
    links. Prior to this release, symbolic links, like other regular files, was
    first deleted and then created. This can result in an unexpected outcome,
    i.e. the deletion of symbolic link. NetCDF-4 library implements this
    differently, by adding O_TRUNC flag when calling open() to truncate the
    file to length 0. Historically, PnetCDF did not adopt the same approach
    because MPI does not define a similar flag to O_TRUNC and the only way to
    achieve the file clobber effect is to through MPI_File_set_size(), which
    can be expensive as the function takes an MPI file handler argument, which
    requires to open the file first with a call to MPI_File_open().
  + Fix various compile and link bugs when NAG Fortran is used. Bugs include
    flag needed to verbose linking output, unrecognized link option -pthread,
    unmatched C compiler underneath. Thanks Sergey Kosukhin for providing the
    fix in [PR #59](https://github.com/Parallel-NetCDF/PnetCDF/pull/59)
    and [PR #60](https://github.com/Parallel-NetCDF/PnetCDF/pull/60)
  + Fix a bug of calling Fortran getarg() with the first argument k with a
    value > 0 when there is no command-line argument is used. NAG Fortran may
    crash the program. See
    [f16bd3c](https://github.com/Parallel-NetCDF/PnetCDF/commit/f16bd3c1ba1b08eade2384f094c519f3f2dc114e)
  + Fix a bug that limits FLASH-IO to run on less than 16K MPI processes. See
    [1d84fa5](https://github.com/Parallel-NetCDF/PnetCDF/commit/1d84fa5d54ca9179da4a5b1a4ee3b92cc92287ed)
